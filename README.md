# Portfolio project

Project related to the full stack nanodegree program.
The idea is to create a single page portfolio updated with all the project I will develop.

It features HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap technologies.

The main files are placed under framework directory:

- index.html - single page portfolio
- test.html  - debug page

The css folder contains css files.
The img folder contains referenced images.
the js  folder contains javascript files.
